This Project is still under construction! You can already use it for Experiments but be ready for extensive API changes even in minor versions.

### Description
>Plain Vaadin applications do not have normal web page navigation as they usually run on a single page, as all Ajax applications do. (https://vaadin.com/docs/-/part/framework/advanced/advanced-navigator.html)

This Library is for Webapplication which aim to look like modern Webapplications with Navigation.  
It comes with a component which allows to archive something similar to the Vaadin Navigator Component (https://vaadin.com/docs/-/part/framework/advanced/advanced-navigator.html). 

The purpose of this Library is to quickly create Applications which require one of the following functionalitiys:
- Multipage Website
- "Responsive" Navigation (Desktop and/or Mobile)
- Login
- Registration
- Access Management 

The Advantage is when using this Library is that different Designs allow you to change the look very easily, while keeping the functionality. If the given Designs are not sufficent just fork one of mine and create your own, you might even consider to give me a link then I can list it here. 

This Library only offers the API how the Designs are to be implemented and some basic Functionality for the Navigation functionality (which also might be replaced by the Navigator) for the Designs, the Designs allow you to archive total different looks.

Design Overview:

Additionally it comes with:  
- CircularProgressBar (Will be moved to a seperate Repositiory)
- Component Printing (This function is limited to the visible html)
- Simplyfied (but more abstracted) Dialog (Window) Creation (with Negative / Postive Buttons)
- Component Pager (Might be replaced by https://vaadin.com/directory#!addon/carousel, because it offers mature especially swiping)
- Object to String Serialization (easy)

Also is comes with more abstracted versions of the following components
- Upload 
- Download
